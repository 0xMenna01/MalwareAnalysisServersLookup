# MalwareAnalysisServersLookup

This repository hosts a simple bash script used to query some malicious servers to see if they respond
with an error code or succesful code. 
It has been done for the purpose of a University Project, for the course MalwareAnalysis.

The HTML file represents the only output response with code 200 at the time of execution.
The html is just some output that tells that the domain name can be bought.
So the malware servers seems to be currently down.
